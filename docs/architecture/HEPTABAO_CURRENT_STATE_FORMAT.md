# Current Service state format and upgrade boundary

Current plan: `HEPTABAO-PLAN-2026-09-07-V2.1`. This is the current format contract,
not a new project plan. It supersedes current-tense schema-2/schema-3 descriptions
in retained increment notes. Exact source remains authoritative.

## Source and authoritative ownership

The current Service state schema is **4**. Its source constant is
`CURRENT_STATE_SCHEMA` in `crates/heptabao-server/src/service.rs`; admission is
`State::validate_format` in `service_identity.rs`. The Service owns one encrypted
state transaction. Auth, engines, database intents and Raft administration are
internal owners, not competing independent stores. Separate seal metadata uses
schema 1; the application schema must never be inferred from that number.

## Read admission and mutation promotion

| Stored application schema | Read/unseal admission |
|---|---|
| 1 | No live-identity, wrapping, lease or remote-JWT state; no database mount/records; default Raft-admin state. |
| 2 | Live Identity is permitted; no wrapping, lease or remote-JWT state; no database mount/records; default Raft-admin state. |
| 3 | Wrapping/local leases are permitted; no remote-JWT state; no database mount/records; default Raft-admin state. |
| 4 | Current format; all normal scope, lease, wrapper, database and Raft-admin validators still apply. |
| Other or contradictory version/content | Fail closed; do not repair the discriminator or drop unknown state. |

Opening a valid older record for a pure read is not permission to silently rewrite
it. Initialization and committed mutations use schema 4. An authenticated
finite-use token decrement is itself a mutation, even when the requested action
is later denied. Such a request can promote the stored format. Failure before
publication does not make the candidate transaction authoritative.

Source tests in `identity_service_tests.rs` cover legacy and contradictory format
admission. Wrapping/SSH/database tests cover their additional owned state.
`python scripts/validate_runtime_doc_truth.py` detects selected documentation
regressions; it does not replace native execution or prove all prose complete.

## Rollback and storage envelopes

The application discriminator is separate from HBS2/HBJ2/HBL2/HBA1 storage and
HA framing. An old binary must refuse unsupported state, not deserialize only
fields it happens to know. Keep a schema-4-capable rollback binary with compatible
HA and provider formats. Never lower `State.schema`, delete new fields, reset
revocation/tombstone state or restore an old snapshot to make a binary start.

A schema-1→2 or schema-2→3 rehearsal only proves its tested historical pair. It is
not a schema-4 rolling upgrade receipt. Mixed-version cluster operation, source
format conversion and production disaster recovery require separate exact-binary
rehearsals. Backup export uses HeptaBao's encrypted format, not OpenBao `raft.snap`.
Local restore is refused in HA mode. Restoring database provider records is also
refused: a local snapshot cannot revoke or reconcile an external database role.

## External state and uncertainty

Database issue/renew/revoke commits a pending intent before TLS/SCRAM provider
entry, verifies independent readback and commits the terminal local result before
releasing a credential. A missing response cannot be treated as no effect. Read
[the PostgreSQL contract](../engines/HEPTABAO_POSTGRESQL_PROVIDER.md) for sequence,
tombstone, ownership and recovery rules. Database PITR or provider-ledger rollback
is outside this format contract.

Raft membership and persisted snapshots are native consensus facts, distinct from
Service configuration. Read [the Raft administration contract](../operations/HEPTABAO_RAFT_ADMINISTRATION.md).
No local schema or authenticated snapshot is an external monotonic rollback anchor.

## Verification and release distinction

Build the exact candidate with the locked toolchain and dependencies. Execute all
workspace tests, strict lint, documentation checks, real TLS, real PostgreSQL,
loopback HA and fixed-binary differential profiles separately. Record source head,
tree, tool and binary digests, process outcomes and applicable unmet prerequisites.
Do not inherit an earlier head's result. A failed or missing prerequisite remains
blocked; two failed implementations do not demonstrate compatibility.

This contract grants no full OpenBao compatibility, independent qualification,
production, migration or release authority. Hardware custody, independent review,
multi-host destructive tests and operational admission remain external evidence.
